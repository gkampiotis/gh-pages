You're gonna do things that you'll regret later. Or even, you're not gonna notice that they were mistakes. And you're gonna, in some way, mess up your child. Everything you do, every gesture, every word, every reaction, is imprinted into the child's brain. It is going to affect it. Good and bad, it's going to change your child.<br><br>Is this a reason to avoid having children? <br><br>It is not. From my point of view, there's only on prerequisite of having children. Have you mastered the basics? If you have, you're good to go. What I've learned from practising martial arts, cooking, sports, and making music is this: Master the basics and you're ahead of 99.9% of other people. That's it. No need for fancy, jaw-dropping, out-of-this-world performances. To win, to create beautiful art, to cook delicious food, all you need to be good at is the basics. <br><br>So what's the basics of parenthood? It's the basics of being yourself and a valuable member of society.<br><br>Do you know how to take care of yourself? How to learn? How to adapt? To give and take? How to love yourself and people around you? Do you know how to leave this place a little better than you found it? If you do, then you're going to be a good parent.<br><br>My love, you're going to be a wonderful mother.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 23, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/personalize-the-advice-you-get.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Personalize the advice you get "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">Personalize the advice you get</span> </a><a href="https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/how-to-stop-negative-thoughts.html" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  How to stop negative thoughts "><span class="btn__text">How to stop negative thoughts</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
