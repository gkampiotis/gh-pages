If you know how to search, there's information for every subject.<br><br>That's what I love about it. But there's a problem. <br><br>There's so many ways of doing things where you can get conflicting instructions/advice for the same thing.<br><br>It's ok. I have a filter for that. <br><br>I carefully select what I read and listen to. If I feel it's just "content" for SEO or any other growth purpose, I ignore the information. If the information comes from people with authority, where they've already done the thing before, then I pay attention.<br><br>That's the difficult part about the internet. To find high integrity people. The easy part comes after you've gone through the first phase of curating "your people." Then you get recommendations from them. In that way. it's easier to expand than to begin.<br><br>There's another problem about this approach. Not actually a problem, but there's something to keep an eye on. <br><br>All this advice, instructions, playbooks, and how-I-did-it stories are personalized to the person sharing the information. They need to be adjusted to your personality.<br><br>If you blindly follow what they did, there's a high probability of failure. Or internal conflict.<br><br>I am guilty of this.<br><br>I've listened and read to all this people, with high qualifications and solid backgrounds, and when I tried to apply something I took from them, it usually didn't work.<br><br>"Of course it didn't work Giannis. It's how THEY did." <br><br>Now, don't get me wrong, the information they give, is solid. But it worked for their personality, for their network, for their time of doing it etc, etc. <br><br>It's best to take the information and ADJUST it to your personality.<br><br>The internet is a wonderful place. But we need to apply a very strict filter and then personalize the information we get.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 23, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/how-to-zig-when-everybody-zags.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  How to zig when everybody zags?
