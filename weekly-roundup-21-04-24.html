The one I noted:</p><p>The transfer of thoughts and ideas to different mediums unlocks different views of it.</p><pre><code>Creativity Razor - If struggling to think creatively about a subject, transform it: Turn a thought into a written idea. A written idea into a drawing. A drawing into an equation. An equation into a conversation. </code><br><br><code>In the process of transforming it, you begin to spot new creative connections.</code></pre><hr><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aggregation Theory - Ben Thompson</a></p><p>A theory for the new state of consumer-based businesses and how they are affected in the post-internet era.<br><br>Before, mass production and distribution was integrated so everyone bought and and read the same things. I got the same newspaper, and other products, as my neighbour. Distribution was localised.<br><br>Post-internet I can get my news, clothes, etc from wherever I want. The internet enabled "personalised" distribution. <a href="https://medium.com/@hagaetc/an-introduction-to-aggregation-theory-7cea63cc0e20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The new scarcity is now that consumers only have 24 hours a day, and the hardest problem is now actually capturing the end-users’ limited attention. The big question now becomes: where do consumers actually look? The answer is, you guessed it: aggregators.</a></p><pre>First, the Internet has made distribution (of digital goods) free, neutralizing the advantage that pre-Internet distributors leveraged to integrate with suppliers. Secondly, the Internet has made transaction costs zero, making it viable for a distributor to integrate forward with end users/consumers at scale.<br><br>[...]<br><br>This has fundamentally changed the plane of competition: no longer do distributors compete based upon exclusive supplier relationships, with consumers/users an afterthought. Instead, suppliers can be commoditized leaving consumers/users as a first order priority. By extension, this means that the most important factor determining success is the user experience: the best distributors/aggregators/market-makers win by providing the best experience, which earns them the most consumers/users, which attracts the most suppliers, which enhances the user experience in a virtuous cycle.</pre><hr><p><a href="https://redef.com/original/age-of-abundance-how-the-content-explosion-will-invert-the-media-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Age of Abundance: How the Content Explosion will Invert the Media Industry</a></p><p>The internet will move from programmatic recommendations to human curation.</p><p>This a 2016 prediction for the future state of media. And it has been a pretty spot on one. The shift from algorithms to curators is still in play and there's still time for anyone interested to create a personal brand through curation.</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M6Q6rI7JII" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Don't choose your niche — be prolific instead</a></p><p>I guess that's a good advice not only about finding your niche but exploring life in general.</p><pre>I was thinking like an architect, trying to design my niche before getting started, when I should have been thinking like an archeologist, slowly uncovering my niche with every little thing I created.</pre><p>Keep creating whatever happens.
