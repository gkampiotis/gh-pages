Negative thoughts. Either about the future, or about a current situation. Worrying is the mind's default state. It's not a bug (malfunction), it's a feature. That's how you survive. But it becomes a problem when the mind is left unchecked. Then it will get into a negative feedback loop and produce bigger and darker thoughts. That's pain.<br><br>I've found a solution.<br><br>The other day I was in my local Muay Thai class and our Instructor was teaching us about rhythm. Specifically, when we get attacked we should break the attacker's rhythm. The logic comes from a common practice: when attacking, you deliver more than one hits (that's a combo). So, when you get attacked, you block the attack. And since you expect more hits, you don't wait for them to land, you <strong>immediately</strong> counter-attack. That way you break the attacker's rhythm. The result: you get hit less.</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13/attacks-3.jpg" alt="getting attacked" width="546" height="290" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13/responsive/attacks-3-xs.jpg 300w, https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13/responsive/attacks-3-sm.jpg 480w, https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13/responsive/attacks-3-md.jpg 768w, https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13/responsive/attacks-3-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure><figcaption>Getting attacked with a combo</figcaption></figure><p>Do you see the analogy?<br><br>When the mind attacks with a negative thought, you don't wait for it to stop so you can feel better. You block it. Then, you attack it with a combo of positive thoughts. Whatever the situation you're in, there's something positive in there. I'm not talking about hopeful thoughts like "it will get better" and the likes. I'm talking about concrete positive thoughts. Like, how good you've handled similar situations in the past. Or, how you can find a lesson in that difficult problem which will lead to overcoming it. These kind of thoughts.<br><br>Yes, it's simple. Yes, it works. Also yes, it's difficult. So start practicing.</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13/counterattacks.jpg" alt="counter attacks" width="546" height="299" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13/responsive/counterattacks-xs.jpg 300w, https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13/responsive/counterattacks-sm.jpg 480w, https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13/responsive/counterattacks-md.jpg 768w, https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/13/responsive/counterattacks-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure><figcaption>Counter attacking stops the attacks so we can hit back</figcaption></figure><p>It will come to a point where you'll sense when the mind is going to attack you. Before it does, you'll quickly respond with positive thoughts.<br><br>Now, our Instructor prefers we don't get hit at all. Even if you block it, a hit is a hit. He wants us to get to the level that we can avoid incoming attacks. That's level 2, being proactive. But since it takes time to reach that body-fluency, and we're definitely gonna get hit, we need to go through level 1. Being reactive. That's blocking and then attacking back.<br><br>To continue our analogy: Level 2 is to avoid the attacks of the mind. To get to that state, you <strong>overwhelm it with positive thoughts.</strong> All the time. Be proactive and don't give to it the opportunity to generate negativity.<br><br>Practice.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 18, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://gkampiotis.github.io/gh-pages/when-are-you-ready-to-be-a-parent.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  When are you ready to be a parent?
